	  This is the file system used by the real-time operating systems
	  QNX 4 and QNX 6 (the latter is also called QNX RTP).
	  Further information is available at <http://www.qnx.com/>.
	  Say Y if you intend to mount QNX hard disks or floppies.
	  Unless you say Y to "QNX4FS read-write support" below, you will
	  only be able to read these file systems.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called qnx4.

	  If you don't know whether you need it, then you don't need it:
	  answer N.

config QNX4FS_RW
	bool "QNX4FS write support (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on QNX4FS_FS && EXPERIMENTAL && BROKEN
	help
	  Say Y if you want to test write support for QNX4 file systems.

	  It's currently broken, so for now:
	  answer N.
