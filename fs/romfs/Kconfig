	depends on BLOCK
	---help---
	  This is a very small read-only file system mainly intended for
	  initial ram disks of installation disks, but it could be used for
	  other read-only media as well.  Read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/romfs.txt> for details.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called romfs.  Note that the file system of your
	  root partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot be a
	  module.

	  If you don't know whether you need it, then you don't need it:
	  answer N.
