config CFG80211_REG_DEBUG
	bool "cfg80211 regulatory debugging"
	depends on CFG80211
	default n
	---help---
	  You can enable this if you want to debug regulatory changes.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CFG80211_DEBUGFS
	bool "cfg80211 DebugFS entries"
	depends on CFG80211 && DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  You can enable this if you want to debugfs entries for cfg80211.

	  If unsure, say N.

config WIRELESS_OLD_REGULATORY
	bool "Old wireless static regulatory definitions"
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables the old static regulatory information
	  and uses it within the new framework. This option is available
	  for historical reasons and it is advised to leave it off.

	  For details see:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/Regulatory

	  Say N and if you say Y, please tell us why. The default is N.

config WIRELESS_EXT
	bool "Wireless extensions"
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables the legacy wireless extensions
	  (wireless network interface configuration via ioctls.)

	  Wireless extensions will be replaced by cfg80211 and
	  will be required only by legacy drivers that implement
	  wireless extension handlers. This option does not
	  affect the wireless-extension backward compatibility
	  code in cfg80211.

	  Say N (if you can) unless you know you need wireless
	  extensions for external modules.

config WIRELESS_EXT_SYSFS
	bool "Wireless extensions sysfs files"
	default y
	depends on WIRELESS_EXT && SYSFS
	help
	  This option enables the deprecated wireless statistics
	  files in /sys/class/net/*/wireless/. The same information
	  is available via the ioctls as well.

	  Say Y if you have programs using it, like old versions of
	  hal.

config LIB80211
	tristate "Common routines for IEEE802.11 drivers"
	default n
	help
	  This options enables a library of common routines used
	  by IEEE802.11 wireless LAN drivers.

	  Drivers should select this themselves if needed.  Say Y if
	  you want this built into your kernel.

	  You can enable this if you want verbose debugging messages
	  from lib80211.

	  If unsure, say N.
