 * @toggle_radio(): Mandatory handler to control state of the radio.
 *	only RFKILL_STATE_SOFT_BLOCKED and RFKILL_STATE_UNBLOCKED are
 *	valid parameters.
 * @get_state(): handler to read current radio state from hardware,
 *      may be called from atomic context, should return 0 on success.

 * @dev: Device structure integrating the switch into device tree.
