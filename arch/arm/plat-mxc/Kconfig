	  Select this if you want to use prioritized IRQ handling.
	  This feature prevents higher priority ISR to be interrupted
	  by lower priority IRQ even IRQF_DISABLED flag is not set.
	  This may be useful in embedded applications, where are strong
	  requirements for timing.
	  Say N here, unless you have a specialized requirement.
