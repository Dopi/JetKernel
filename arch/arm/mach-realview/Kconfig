	default n
	help
	  Enable support for the ARM11MPCore RevB tile on the Realview

	  RealView boards other than PB1176 have the RAM available at
	  0x70000000, 256MB of which being mirrored at 0x00000000. If
	  the board supports 512MB of RAM, this option allows the
	  memory to be accessed contiguously at the high physical
	  offset.
