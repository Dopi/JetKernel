	  This enables support for the EVKLCD100 (QVGA) or EVKLCD101 (VGA)
	  addon board for the NGW100. By enabling this the LCD controller and
	  AC97 controller is added as platform devices.

	  This choice disables the detect pin and the write-protect pin for the
	  MCI platform device, since it conflicts with the LCD platform device.
	  The MCI pins can be reenabled by editing the "add device function" but
	  this may break the setup for other displays that use these pins.

	  Choose 'Y' here if you have a EVKLCD100/101 connected to the NGW100.
