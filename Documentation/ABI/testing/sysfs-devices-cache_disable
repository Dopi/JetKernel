KernelVersion:	2.6.27
Contact:	mark.langsdorf@amd.com
Description:	These files exist in every cpu's cache index directories.
		There are currently 2 cache_disable_# files in each
		directory.  Reading from these files on a supported
		processor will return that cache disable index value
		for that processor and node.  Writing to one of these
		files will cause the specificed cache index to be disabled.

		Currently, only AMD Family 10h Processors support cache index
		disable, and only for their L3 caches.  See the BIOS and
		Kernel Developer's Guide at
		http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/31116-Public-GH-BKDG_3.20_2-4-09.pdf
		for formatting information and other details on the
		cache index disable.
