txcontrol [DefaultFlags (if no UP setting)] [UserPriority] [UserPriorityFlags]
    This command is used to set/get the TX rate, WMM ack policy, and 
       retry limit for all packets, or selectively the packets with a specific
       user priority.

    The DefaultFlags setting is ignored for any command with 2 or more 
       arguments.

    The value of the u32 txcontrol flags returned and input for 
       DefaultFlags or UserPriorityFlags specific settings is given by the
       following bitmap:

    bit[4:0], if bit[4] == 1:
      bit[3:0]        -- 0  1  2    3   4   5  6  7   8   9   10  11  12  13-16
      Data Rate(Mbps) -- 1  2  5.5  11  Rsv 6  9  12  18  24  36  48  54  Rsv

    bit[12:8] 
      if bit[12] == 1, bit[11:8] specifies the Tx retry limit.

    bit[14:13] specifies per packet ack policy:
      if bit[14] == 1, bit[13] == 1 specifies No Ack Policy

    All unused and reserved bits should be set to zero for the entire 
      u32 field.

    Usage:
      Number of arguments given:

      0: Return the default setting for the txcontrol flags
         > iwpriv eth1 txcontrol

      1: Set the default value for the txcontrol flags

         > iwpriv eth1 txcontrol 0x151A  - 5 retries, 36Mbps

      2: Return a specific User Priority setting.  If the UP setting is zero,
         the default value will be used and returned:
         > iwpriv eth1 txcontrol 0 7  - Return UP 7 txcontrol value (UP7 = VO)

      3: Set a User Priority specific value for the txcontrol flags.  A value
         of zero will revert to the default setting:
         > iwpriv eth1 txcontrol 0 5 0x6013 - (UP5 = VI), No ACK 11Mbps.

caldataext
	In order to overcome the situation without EEPROM in the WLAN module, 
	we send the extension calibration command to modify the existing 
	hardware-spec command. This command takes one parameter that specifies 
	the file name of the configuration file.

	Usage:
	wlanconfig eth1 caldataext <cal_data_ext_set_<version>.conf>
		cal_data_ext_set_<version>.conf is a configuration file to the

bca-ts
	This command is used to set/get the BCA timeshare parameters.
 
	This command only works after BCA been enabled. 
	
	Usage:

		where:
			Traffic Type 0 - Wlan and bluetooth are low priority.
				     1 - Wlan and bluetooth are high priority.
 	
			TimeShareInterval value is not multiple of 10 then floor value 
			is taken and the valid range is < 20 ... 60,000 > in milliseconds.

			BTTime value is  not multiple of 10 then floor value is
			taken and the valid range is < 0 ... TimeShareInterval value >
			in milliseconds.

	Example:
		wlanconfig ethX bca-ts get 1  
				get the BCA timeshare settings when wlan and bluetooth are set to high priority.  

		wlanconfig ethX bca-ts set 1 30 20
				set wlan and bluetooth to high priority, wlan TimeShareInterval to 30ms, BTTime to 20ms.

      wc="[WILDCARD SSID]"     specify a UNIX pattern matching filter (using *
                               and ?) for SSIDs found in a broadcast probe 
      keep=[0 or 1]            keep the previous scan results (1), discard (0)
      dur=[scan time]          time to scan for each channel in milliseconds
      probes=[#]               number of probe requests to send on each chan
                               for each broadcast probe required and each SSID
                               specific probe required
      type=[1,2,3]             BSS type: 1 (Infra), 2(Adhoc), 3(Any)
 
    Any combination of the above arguments can be supplied on the command line.
      If the chan token is absent, a full channel scan will be completed by 
      the driver.  If the dur or probes tokens are absent, the driver default
      setting will be used.  The bssid and ssid fields, if blank, 
      will produce an unfiltered scan. The type field will default to 3 (Any)
      and the keep field will default to 0 (Discard).

    Examples:
    1) Perform an active scan on channels 1, 6, and 11 in the 'g' band:
            setuserscan chan=1g,6g,11g

    2) Perform a passive scan on channel 11 for 20 ms:
            setuserscan chan=11gp dur=20

    3) Perform an active scan on channels 1, 6, and 11; and a passive scan on
       channel 36 in the 'a' band:
            setuserscan chan=1g,6g,11g,36ap

    4) Perform an active scan on channel 6 and 36 for a specific SSID:
            setuserscan chan=6g,36a ssid="TestAP"

    5) Scan all available channels (B/G, A bands) for a specific BSSID, keep
       the current scan table intact, update existing or append new scan data:
            setuserscan bssid=00:50:43:20:12:82 keep=1

    6) Scan channel 6, for all infrastructure networks, sending two probe 
       requests.  Keep the previous scan table intact. Update any duplicate
       BSSID/SSID matches with the new scan data:
            setuserscan chan=6g type=1 probes=2 keep=1

    7) Scan channel 1 and 6, for all networks matching the Mrvl*AP
       or AP*Mrvl? patterns and for MrvlTst SSID.  Generate 3 broadcast
       probes for the patterns and 3 SSID specific probes for MrvlTst on
       both channel 1 and channel 6.
            chan=1g,6g probes=3 wc="Mrvl*AP" wc="AP*Mrvl?" ssid="MrvlTst"

    All entries in the scan table (not just the new scan data when keep=1) 
    will be displayed upon completion by use of the getscantable ioctl.

    Display the current contents of the driver scan table

    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX getscantable
       wlanconfig ethX getscantable [#]

       wlanconfig ethX getscantable help

    1) Without argument, the entire scantable is displayed.
    2) Specifying a # will display detailed information about a specific scan
       table entry.  '0' displays driver cached information regarding the 
       current association (if any).
    3) The tsf argument will display the entire scan table with the recorded
       TSF timestamp for the entry.
    4) The help argument will display the legend for the capability field

getassocrsp

       wlanconfig ethX getassocrsp

setmrvltlv

       association command to the firmware.  

    wlanconfig will provision a test TLV that can be verified in the assoc.
       response to the AP.  Used to test the IOCTL functionality.

    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX setmrvltlv

addts
    Send an ADDTS command to the associated AP.

    Process a given conf file for a specific TSPEC data block.  Send the
      TSPEC along with any other IEs to the driver/firmware for transmission
      in an ADDTS request to the associated AP.  
 
    Return the execution status of the command as well as the ADDTS response
      from the AP if any.
   
    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX addts <filename.conf> <section# of tspec> <timeout(ms)>

delts
    Send a DELTS command to the associated AP.

    Process a given conf file for a specific TSPEC data block.  Send the
      TSPEC along with any other IEs to the driver/firmware for transmission
      in a DELTS request to the associated AP.  
 
    Return the execution status of the command.  There is no response to a
      DELTS from the AP.
   
    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX delts <filename.conf> <section# of tspec>

qconfig
