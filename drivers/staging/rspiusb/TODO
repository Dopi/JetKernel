This driver is for the Princeton Instruments USB camera.

It needs lots of work to get it into the main drivers/usb/ subdirectory:

Any patches to do any of the following changes are greatly appreciated:

	- make checkpatch.pl clean
	- coding style fixups (typedefs, etc.)
	- get it to build properly
	- audit ioctls
	- remove ioctls if possible
	- assign proper minor number
	- remove dbg() macro
	- lots of general cleanups
	- review locking

Please send patches to:
	Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
and CC:
	Judd Montgomery <judd@jpilot.org>
	Jeff Frontz <jeff.frontz@gmail.com>
as they have this device and can test any needed changes.
