This directory contains the USB Tranzport and Alphatrack Kernel drivers for Linux.

At present the tranzport does reads/writes of 8 byte cmds to /dev/tranzport0 to control
the lights and screen and wheel

At present the alphatrack accepts reads/writes of 12 byte cmds to /dev/tranzport0 to control
the lights and screen and fader.

Both drivers also have some sysfs hooks that are non-functional at the moment.

The API is currently closely tied to the ardour revision and WILL change.

A sysfs interface is PERFECT for simple userspace apps to do fun things with the
lights and screen. It's fairly lousy for handling input events and very lousy
for watching the state of the shuttle wheel.

A linux input events interface is great for the input events and shuttle wheel. It's
theoretically OK on LEDs. A Fader can be mapped to an absolute mouse device.
But there is no LCD support at all.

In the end this is going to be driven by a midi layer, which handles all those
cases via a defined API, but - among other things - is slow, doesn't do
flow control, and is a LOT of extra work. Frankly, I'd like to keep the
core driver simple because the only realtime work really required is
the bottom half interrupt handler and the output overlapping.

Exposing some sort of clean aio api to userspace would be perfect. What that
API looks like? Gah. beats me.
