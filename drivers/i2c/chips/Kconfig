config DS1682
	tristate "Dallas DS1682 Total Elapsed Time Recorder with Alarm"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Dallas Semiconductor
	  DS1682 Total Elapsed Time Recorder.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called ds1682.

config AT24
	tristate "EEPROMs from most vendors"
	depends on SYSFS && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Enable this driver to get read/write support to most I2C EEPROMs,
	  after you configure the driver to know about each EEPROM on
	  your target board.  Use these generic chip names, instead of
	  vendor-specific ones like at24c64 or 24lc02:

	     24c00, 24c01, 24c02, spd (readonly 24c02), 24c04, 24c08,
	     24c16, 24c32, 24c64, 24c128, 24c256, 24c512, 24c1024

	  Unless you like data loss puzzles, always be sure that any chip
	  you configure as a 24c32 (32 kbit) or larger is NOT really a
	  24c16 (16 kbit) or smaller, and vice versa. Marking the chip
	  as read-only won't help recover from this. Also, if your chip
	  has any software write-protect mechanism you may want to review the
	  code to make sure this driver won't turn it on by accident.

	  If you use this with an SMBus adapter instead of an I2C adapter,
	  full functionality is not available.  Only smaller devices are
	  supported (24c16 and below, max 4 kByte).

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called at24.

config SENSORS_EEPROM
	tristate "EEPROM reader"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get read-only access to the EEPROM data
	  available on modern memory DIMMs and Sony Vaio laptops.  Such
	  EEPROMs could theoretically be available on other devices as well.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called eeprom.

config SENSORS_PCF8574
	tristate "Philips PCF8574 and PCF8574A (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && GPIO_PCF857X = "n"
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Philips PCF8574 and 
	  PCF8574A chips. These chips are 8-bit I/O expanders for the I2C bus.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pcf8574.

	  This driver is deprecated and will be dropped soon. Use
	  drivers/gpio/pcf857x.c instead.

	  These devices are hard to detect and rarely found on mainstream
	  hardware.  If unsure, say N.

config PCF8575
	tristate "Philips PCF8575 (DEPRECATED)"
	default n
	depends on GPIO_PCF857X = "n"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Philips PCF8575 chip.
	  This chip is a 16-bit I/O expander for the I2C bus.  Several other
	  chip manufacturers sell equivalent chips, e.g. Texas Instruments.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pcf8575.

	  This driver is deprecated and will be dropped soon. Use
	  drivers/gpio/pcf857x.c instead.

	  This device is hard to detect and is rarely found on mainstream
	  hardware.  If unsure, say N.

config SENSORS_PCA9539
	tristate "Philips PCA9539 16-bit I/O port (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && GPIO_PCA953X = "n"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips PCA9539
	  16-bit I/O port.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pca9539.

	  This driver is deprecated and will be dropped soon. Use
	  drivers/gpio/pca953x.c instead.

config SENSORS_PCF8591
	tristate "Philips PCF8591"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Philips PCF8591 chips.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pcf8591.

	  These devices are hard to detect and rarely found on mainstream
	  hardware.  If unsure, say N.

config TPS65010
	tristate "TPS6501x Power Management chips"
