config DS1682
	tristate "Dallas DS1682 Total Elapsed Time Recorder with Alarm"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Dallas Semiconductor
	  DS1682 Total Elapsed Time Recorder.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called ds1682.

config SENSORS_PCF8574
	tristate "Philips PCF8574 and PCF8574A (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && GPIO_PCF857X = "n"
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Philips PCF8574 and 
	  PCF8574A chips. These chips are 8-bit I/O expanders for the I2C bus.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pcf8574.

	  This driver is deprecated and will be dropped soon. Use
	  drivers/gpio/pcf857x.c instead.

	  These devices are hard to detect and rarely found on mainstream
	  hardware.  If unsure, say N.

config PCF8575
	tristate "Philips PCF8575 (DEPRECATED)"
	default n
	depends on GPIO_PCF857X = "n"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Philips PCF8575 chip.
	  This chip is a 16-bit I/O expander for the I2C bus.  Several other
	  chip manufacturers sell equivalent chips, e.g. Texas Instruments.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pcf8575.

	  This driver is deprecated and will be dropped soon. Use
	  drivers/gpio/pcf857x.c instead.

	  This device is hard to detect and is rarely found on mainstream
	  hardware.  If unsure, say N.

config SENSORS_PCA9539
	tristate "Philips PCA9539 16-bit I/O port (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && GPIO_PCA953X = "n"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips PCA9539
	  16-bit I/O port.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pca9539.

	  This driver is deprecated and will be dropped soon. Use
	  drivers/gpio/pca953x.c instead.

config SENSORS_PCF8591
	tristate "Philips PCF8591"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Philips PCF8591 chips.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pcf8591.

	  These devices are hard to detect and rarely found on mainstream
	  hardware.  If unsure, say N.

config SENSORS_MAX6875
	tristate "Maxim MAX6875 Power supply supervisor"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Maxim MAX6875
	  EEPROM-programmable, quad power-supply sequencer/supervisor.

	  This provides an interface to program the EEPROM and reset the chip.

	  This driver also supports the Maxim MAX6874 hex power-supply
	  sequencer/supervisor if found at a compatible address.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called max6875.

config SENSORS_TSL2550
	tristate "Taos TSL2550 ambient light sensor"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Taos TSL2550
	  ambient light sensor.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called tsl2550.

config SENSORS_PCA963X
	tristate "Philips PCA963X 4-bit I2C-bus LED"
	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Philips PCA963X
	 4-bit I2C-bus LED.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called pca963X.

config PMIC_MAX8906
	tristate "Maxim MAX8906 Power Management chip"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support fot the Maxim MAX8906
	  Power Management chip.

	  This provides Applocations and Baseband Processor Power Management,
	  ADC/TSC, RTC, and Audio Subsystem for Mobile Applications.

config PMIC_MAX8698
	tristate "Maxim MAX8698 Power Management chip"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support fot the Maxim MAX8698
	  Power Management chip.

	  This provides Applocations Processor Power Management,
	  ADC/TSC, RTC, and Audio Subsystem for Mobile Applications.
